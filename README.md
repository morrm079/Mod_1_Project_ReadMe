# King County House Sales Linear Regression

Given sale prices of previous how sales, how accurately can we predict future house sales and which features of the house/property aid in the prediction?

## DataSet 

We were given a dataset of house sale prices for King Country. Along with the sale prices, we were given features of the houses such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms of the house and other property features. Some of the data did need to be cleaned, as some data was missing for certain sales and some of the features were not in the listed in the correct format. 

## Important Features

By analyzing the data, we were able to see that certain features were more important in determining the sale price of a home than others. One of the most important features being the grade the county gave to the home. It is based on a sale from 1-13, with the 13 being the best score possible.
